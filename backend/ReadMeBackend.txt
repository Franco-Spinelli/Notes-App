The backend portion of the project has the following specifications:

- Spring Boot Version: 3.2.1
- Java Version: 17
- Build Tool: Maven

Postman was used to test various API requests.

Additionally, the backend is configured to recreate tables and perform inserts from the `import.sql` file every time the program is started. 
This ensures that the database is initialized with the required data upon program startup.
