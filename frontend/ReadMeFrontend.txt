# Note App

Welcome to the Note App, your personal space for organizing and managing your notes. The main page allows you to view all your notes, categorized as active or archived. You can easily search for notes based on their categories. Each note provides options to edit, archive, or delete. Clicking on "NOTE APP" in the top-right corner takes you back to the main page.

### Editing Notes
When you choose to edit a note, you'll be directed to a separate page featuring a form. Here, you can input new data and seamlessly update your notes.

### Categories
Navigate to the "CATEGORIES" section to explore and manage your categories. Here, you can view all existing categories, add new ones, or delete unwanted categories. It's important to note that deleting a category also removes any associated notes.
